## Description
<p>
  This project was developed as a free of charge system for an elementary school that needed help managing grades and SisAT assessment results, as well as generating documents with these results. The Windows application was built using C# and a MySQL database.
  <br><br>
  The system recognizes two types of users: Principal and Teachers. When logged in as a Principal, the user can: modify their information, view student lists for each grade, manage teachers, view assessment results, and generate a graph of the schools' overall performance to compare results with past periods. When logged in as a Teacher, the user can: modify their information, manage students, record grades by period, generate a document with the grades for the specified period, record assessment results, and finally, generate a document and graph with the recorded assessment results.
