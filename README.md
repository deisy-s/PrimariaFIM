## Description
<p>
  This application is a specialized administrative solution developed as a pro-bono project for an elementary school. It streamlines the management of academic grades and SisAT (Sistema de Alerta Temprana) assessment results, replacing manual tracking with a robust C# and MySQL desktop environment. The system features a tailored user experience through Role-Based Access Control, ensuring that data integrity is maintained while providing both administrative oversight for the Principal and classroom tools for Teachers.
